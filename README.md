# New-York-Jobs-CEO-council - virtual Experience program

## Description
During this program, i got the opportunity to step into the shoes of a software engineer and complete tasks that replicate the work they do every day. I learned key skills in code review, Python, and written feature requirements.

### Task
Given the file: [spinvoice.py](https://cdn.theforage.com/vinternships/companyassets/9nvkLZzZEKAdrhjrX/m2PZ8KAEvh7fesa2Z/1685571147268/task_1_starter_code.py)
I have to find a bug that has something to do with the way discounts are being applied to the final price.

Instructions:  
    ```
    An invoice tracks the name, address, and email of both its sender and recipient.
    An invoice tracks the date it was created, as well as items to charge for.
    An item may be added to an existing invoice.
    Each item has an associated name, price, and percent tax.
    The total price of an invoice is the sum of all its constituent items.
    A percent discount may be applied to the entire invoice.
    A discount must be applied before tax is determined.
    An invoice must calculate its total price based on all contained items.
    ```
